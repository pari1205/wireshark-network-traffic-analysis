Tools Used:
- Wireshark

Objective:
The goal of this task was to capture live network packets and analyze network traffic using Wireshark, identifying basic communication protocols such as TCP, DNS, and ARP.

Steps Taken:
1. Installed Wireshark on the system.
2. Started packet capture on the active network interface.
3. Opened websites and used the ping command to generate network traffic.
4. Stopped the capture after 1 minute.
5. Applied filters (tcp, dns, arp) to isolate different protocols.
6. Identified at least three protocols from the traffic.
7. Saved the capture as a .pcap file.
8. Documented the findings in this report.

Protocols Identified:
1. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) - Used for reliable data transfer.
2. DNS (Domain Name System) - Resolves domain names to IP addresses.
3. ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) - Resolves IP addresses to MAC addresses.
